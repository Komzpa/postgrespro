# pathman

The `pathman` module provides optimized partitioning mechanism and functions to manage partitions.

## pathman Concepts

Partitioning refers to splitting one large table into smaller pieces. Each row in such table assigns to a single partition based on partitioning key. Common partitioning strategies are:

* HASH - maps rows to partitions based on hash function values;
* RANGE - maps data to partitions based on ranges that you establish for each partition;
* LIST - maps data to partitions based on explicitly specified values of partitioning key for each partition.

PostgreSQL supports partitioning via table inheritance. Each partition must be created as child table with CHECK CONSTRAINT. For example:

```
CHECK ( id >= 100 AND id < 200 )
CHECK ( id >= 200 AND id < 300 )
```

Despite the flexibility of this approach it has weakness. If query uses filtering the optimizer forced to perform an exhaustive search and check constraints for each partition to determine partitions from which it should select data. If the number of partitions is large the overhead may be significant.

The `pathman` module provides functions to manage partitions and partitioning mechanism optimized based on knowledge of the partitions structure. It stores partitioning configuration in the `pathman_config` table, each row of which contains single entry for partitioned table (relation name, partitioning key and type). During initialization the `pathman` module caches information about child partitions in shared memory in form convenient to perform rapid search. When user executes SELECT query pathman analyzes conditions tree looking for conditions like:

```
VARIABLE OP CONST
```
where `VARIABLE` is partitioning key, `OP` is comparison operator (supported operators are =, <, <=, >, >=), `CONST` is scalar value. For example:

```
WHERE id = 150
```

Based on partitioning type and operator the `pathman` searches corresponding partitions and builds the plan.

## Installation

To install pathman run:
```
make install
```
from its directory. Then modify shared_preload_libraries parameter in postgres.conf as following:
```
shared_preload_libraries = 'pathman'
```
It will require to restart the PostgreSQL instance.

## Pathman Functions

### Partitions Creation
```
CREATE FUNCTION create_hash_partitions(
    relation TEXT,
    attribute TEXT,
    partitions_count INTEGER)
```
Performs HASH partitioning for `relation` by integer key `attribute`. Creates `partitions_count` partitions and trigger on INSERT. Data doesn't automatically copied from parent table to partitions. Use `partition_data()` function (see below) to migrate data.

```
CREATE FUNCTION create_range_partitions(
    relation TEXT,
    attribute TEXT,
    start_value ANYELEMENT,
    interval ANYELEMENT,
    premake INTEGER)
```
Performs RANGE partitioning for `relation` by partitioning key `attribute`. `start_value` argument specifies initial value, `interval` sets the range of values in a single partition, `premake` is the number of premade partitions (the only one partition will be created if `premake` is 0).
```
CREATE FUNCTION create_range_partitions(
    relation TEXT,
    attribute TEXT,
    start_value ANYELEMENT,
    interval INTERVAL,
    premake INTEGER)
```
Same as above but suitable for `DATE` and `TIMESTAMP` partitioning keys.

### Data migration
```
CREATE FUNCTION partition_data(parent text)
```
Copies data from parent table to its partitions.

### Partitions management
```
CREATE FUNCTION split_range_partition(partition TEXT, value ANYELEMENT)
```
Splits RANGE `partition` in two by `value`.
```
CREATE FUNCTION merge_range_partitions(partition1 TEXT, partition2 TEXT)
```
Merge two adjacent RANGE partitions. Data from `partition2` is copied to `partition1`. Then the `partition2` is removed.
```
CREATE FUNCTION append_partition(p_relation TEXT)
```
Appends new partition with the range equal to the range of the previous partition.
```
CREATE FUNCTION prepend_partition(p_relation TEXT)
```
Prepends new partition with the range equal to the range of the first partition.
```
CREATE FUNCTION disable_partitioning(relation TEXT)
```
Disables `pathman` partitioning mechanism for the specified parent table and removes an insert trigger. Partitions itself remain unchanged.

## Examples
### HASH
Consider an example of HASH partitioning. First create a table with some integer column:
```
CREATE TABLE hash_rel (
    id      SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    value   INTEGER);
INSERT INTO hash_rel (value) SELECT g FROM generate_series(1, 10000) as g;
```
Then run create_hash_partitions() function with appropriate arguments:
```
SELECT create_hash_partitions('hash_rel', 'value', 100);
```
This will create new partitions but data will still be in the parent table. To move data to the corresponding partitions use partition_data() function:
```
SELECT partition_data('hash_rel');
```
### RANGE
Consider an example of RANGE partitioning. Create a table with numerical or date or timestamp column:
```
CREATE TABLE range_rel (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    dt TIMESTAMP);
INSERT INTO range_rel (dt) SELECT g FROM generate_series('2010-01-01'::date, '2015-12-31'::date, '1 day') as g;
```
Run create_range_partitions() function to create partitions so that each partition would contain data for one month:
```
SELECT create_range_partitions('range_rel', 'dt', '2010-01-01'::date, '1 month'::interval, 59);
```
It will create 60 partitions (one partition is created regardless of `premake` parameter). Now move data from the parent to partitions.
```
SELECT partition_data('range_rel');
```
To merge to adjacent partitions run merge_range_partitions() function:
```
SELECT merge_range_partitions('range_rel_1', 'range_rel_2');
```
To split partition use split_range_partition() function:
```
SELECT split_range_partition('range_rel_1', '2010-02-15'::date);
```
Now let's create new partition. You can use append_partition() or prepend_partition() functions:
```
SELECT append_partition('range_rel');
SELECT append_partition('range_rel');
```
